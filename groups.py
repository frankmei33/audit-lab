def expand_contest_group_defs(e):
    """
    Expand contest group definitions so that we have a definition
    for each contest group purely in terms of its contests.

    The input definitions are in e.cgids_g, which gives definition
    of each contests group as an ordered list of cids and gids, 
    for each gid.

    The output goes into e.cids_g, which gives just an ordered list
    e.cids_g[gid] for the cids in each group.

    This is a simple reachability computation in a directed graph,
    using repeated depth-first search starting from each gid node.

    A warning is printed if the gid graph has any cycles.

    When the graph is acyclic, this is just like doing a derviation of
    a string in a context-free grammar, where the cids are the "terminals"
    and the gids are the "nonterminals".  Each gid generates exactly one
    string.

    The reason for using ordered lists here (as opposed to sets)
    is that this may reflect the order in which the contests appear 
    on a ballot.

    contests appended to it.
